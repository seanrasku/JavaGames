# JavaGames

Java project I expanded from a school project that is a command line version of the games Tic Tac Toe and Nim. I expanded upon the project, and added componentization, more interfaces, and created total abstraction for classes called from Main. This was
my first Java project, and I plan to expand my skillset with larger projects in the future.
